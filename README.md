# ChromeTA

## Introduction
Did you encounter difficulties in long waiting time and limited slots during office hours? Did you feel struggling in writing effective prompt to gnenerative AI to ask questions? We designed this multimodel, generative AI teaching assistant, Chrome TA to solve these difficulties. Just like human TA, Chrome TA can listen, speak and read screensharing content all at the same time with the help of multiple generative APIs. In addition to multiple interaction modalities, we incorperate learning sciences theories to the information design in each next-step hints to ensure the pedagogical validities of our product. Furthermore, Chrome TA can be easily transferred to broader domains for general searching purposes such as searching an item appears in a frame from a video. By the end of the submission, we finished the voice interaction and screensharing feature, as well as the hint design. A more seamless interaction and interaction experience will be enhanced in the future.
